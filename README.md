# obsidian-publish-css

the publish.css file for my personal website [https://mister-chad.com](https://mister-chad.com)

as always, an ongoing evolution through tweaking and refinement. i'll try to remember to update here when i can.

big rewrite updated on 2023.03.05 because obsidian updated their publish standards which broke some of my css.
